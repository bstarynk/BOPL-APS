BOPL-APS
========

A parser for the BOPL language in ECLiPSe-CLP [a dialect of Prolog] 

BOPL is a toy language useful to teach parsing and semantics

ECLiPSe or ECLiPSe-CLP is a Prolog dialect, see http://eclipseclp.org/
(it is totally unrelated to the Eclipse editor for Java)

Some of the code is inspired by source code by Professor J.Malenfant

for his APS lectures (Analyse des Programmes et SÃ©mantique)
